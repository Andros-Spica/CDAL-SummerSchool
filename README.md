# CDAL-SummerSchool

Materials for the session organised by the Computational and Digital Archaeology Laboratory (CDAL) in the Peterhouse Archaeology Summer School at Cambridge University (5-9/8/2019)

CDAL is a group based on the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research at the University of Cambridge (https://www.mcdonald.cam.ac.uk/).

This exercise introduces some Geographic Information Systems (GIS) techniques used in archaeology. More specifically, it focus on visibility network and cumulative viewshed procedures available in the plugin named "Visibility Analysis" in the Quantum GIS or QGIS software.

Download the content of this repository to your local computer and install QGIS (https://qgis.org/en/site/). Follow the instruction in the pdf document that better corresponds to the QGIS version installed in your computer (2.18 or 3.8). All necessary data for this exercise is inside the "data" folder.

The final outcome of this exercise should be similar to the following image:
